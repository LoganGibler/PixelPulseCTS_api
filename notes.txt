PixelPulse Labs Consolidating ticketing system.

    Things to figure out:
        attachments that arent just screenshots, where to store them externally? Firebase is likely.

    
    DB schemas:
        usertable:
            ID 
            Name 
            [Team or Teams]
            role ?
            email
            Office phone
            Pager phone


        Ticket Schemas:
                Maybe a different table per ticket type???                                                           
                What about having multiple teams per ticket? have an input box like original CTS?
            ticketID
            type: event, incident, service request, change, maintenance
            title
            description
            priority: 1-4
            date created
            date last edited
            status: Open, In Progress, Closed, resolved, waiting for 3rd party, waiting for approval
            approved: true/false (only if change ticket will this matter)
            assignedTeam
            submitter
            implementation date range
            assignedTo
            auditString, aka "sent to supply chain 01/02/2024 12:05pm, sent to FTE team 1:10pm, ticket changed to active 1:15pm"

            Drawing out DB schemas
            starting DB querys
            Email => ticket created - using autoforwarding to a 3rd party vendor, that fowards to api for ticket creation.
